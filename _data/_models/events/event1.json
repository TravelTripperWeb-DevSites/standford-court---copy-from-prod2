Through approximately sixty paintings, the exhibition demonstrates the radical invention that marked the artist&rsquo;s development during the formative years of 1858 to 1872. In this period the young painter developed his unique visual language and technique, creating striking works that manifested his interest in painting textures and the interplay of light upon surfaces.</p>\n<p style=\"box-sizing: inherit; margin: 0px 0px 25px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-variant-numeric: inherit; font-stretch: inherit; font-size: 16px; line-height: inherit; font-family: roboto, sans-serif; vertical-align: baseline; color: #3e3e3e;\">This exhibition is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to experience Monet&rsquo;s mastery before Impressionism, and includes paintings that are profoundly daring and surprising. Depictions of moments both large and small, with friends and loved ones, in the solitude of forests and fields and in the quiet scenes of everyday, offer new revelations about an artist that many consider to be ubiquitous.</p>",
