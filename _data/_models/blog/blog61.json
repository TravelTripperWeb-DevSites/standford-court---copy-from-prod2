	"long_description": "<p style=\"text-align: center;\">It would be an understatement to say we&rsquo;re just a little techie @ SCH. We digitalize, virtualize and streamline everything we can get our hands on. From the check-in 2 check-out, Stanford Court Hotel uses state-of-the-art technology to compliment our impeccable service. Here&rsquo;s what you can expect when you walk thru the SCH doors.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h4 style=\"text-align: center;\">High-Speed WiFi</h4>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Every guest knows this is hands-down the most important amenity of any hotel. Unfortunately, not all hotels take it as seriously as they should. Fortunately, at SCH we can&rsquo;t live without our WiFi - must less slow connection speeds. That&rsquo;s why we have lightning fast WiFi all over the hotel.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h4 style=\"text-align: center;\">MacBooks, iPads, &amp; iPad minis</h4>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">If you want to leave your electronics at home, you can when you stay at SCH. We&rsquo;ve got enough MacBooks, iPads, and iPad minis to go around. Located throughout our lobby and the SCH business center, here you can look up whatever you need, make your next travel reservations, print boarding passes using our wireless printer, or even file that expense report you haven&rsquo;t gotten around to.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h4 style=\"text-align: center;\">Vizzit</h4>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">SCH also does guided guided neighborhood tour of Nob Hill through the app <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.vizzitapp.vizzit&amp;hl=en\">Vizzit</a>. With Vizzit, you get an audio-visual walking tour right on your phone. The app also has a hands-free option that triggers audio stories in specific points according to the GPS. In the meantime, check out the <a href=\"https://www.stanfordcourt.com/blog/stanford-court-guide-2-nob-hill/\">SCH Guide 2 Nob Hill</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h4 style=\"text-align: center;\">Rockbot</h4>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Rockbot is our digital jukebox. With <a href=\"https://rockbot.com/\">Rockbot</a>, it&rsquo;s the SCH guests that get to choose the music at the hotel. All you have to do is download the Rockbot app, and from there you decide.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h4 style=\"text-align: center;\">Folio</h4>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">We also offer our guests a plethora of reading material via our digital subscription <a href=\"http://www.foliomag.com/\">Folio</a>. With Folio, guests can keep up with the latest in the media, publishing and digital world.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h4 style=\"text-align: center;\">Electric Car Charging Station</h4>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">If you&rsquo;re driving your electric car to San Francisco, we&rsquo;ve got you taken care of - and not just in terms of parking. SCH also has its own charging station for your electric car. Talk about convenience.&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">--</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Like what you&rsquo;re reading?
