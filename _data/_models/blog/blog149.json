So, we were absolutely tickled to be featured in two local magazines that covered our #NeverStopStartingUp reboot.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: center;\">The Nob Hill Gazette&rsquo;s article focused on the upswing of luxury hotels in the area and why the neighborhood is so desirable to out-of-towners. It recognized Stanford Court&rsquo;s nod to the past with its reboot, including design accents that pay homage to old SF, but also its tech-forward amenities.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: center;\">Our totally revamped 24-hour fitness center is outfitted with state-of-the-art equipment, and FloWater filling stations are available throughout the hotel, which help to reduce waste and keep our guests hydrated with filtered drinking water.&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/3NgprPxs2H45az4zqppN6V9-NZC8SW0pAt2gSrUWa3RZoUmNmab1bUt59pV9Ay4fRGmqe-7W2tBgiPozUGwgQiYzsmgt41aZSoOBoq4byFJPfyeaW3PnQz9NdVIw1wAd0h4PjtTu\" width=\"357\" height=\"347\" /></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: center;\">&nbsp;Our #LayingDownTheTracks elements were also highlighted in &ldquo;<a href=\"http://www.7x7.com/the-good-life-at-stanford-court-2500914498.html\">The Good Life at Stanford Court</a>&rdquo;, an article that appeared in SF&rsquo;s lifestyle source 7x7.
