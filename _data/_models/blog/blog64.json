	"long_description": "<p style=\"text-align: center;\">The San Francisco summers are like no other. Cool and foggy, the SF summer is perfect for escaping the heat of your hometown - and watching the fog roll in over the bay. It&rsquo;s also the time for some of SF&rsquo;s best festivals, as well as some of SCH&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://www.stanfordcourt.com/special/#summer-of-love\">best specials</a>. So if you&rsquo;re planning a trip to San Francisco this summer, consider making a pit stop at some of these festivals:</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img id=\"1492791888509\" class=\" \" src=\"https://cdn.traveltripper.io/site-assets/192_617_2164/media/2017-04-21-121209/san-francisco-festivals-pride-2.jpg\" /></p>\n<h4 style=\"text-align: center;\">San Francisco Pride</h4>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><strong>June 24-25, 2017</strong></em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">The biggest pride celebration in the nation, <a href=\"http://www.sfpride.org/\">SF Pride</a> draws over one million people each year to the Civic Center Plaza, and every year more and more people come out to show their support for the community. That said, get there early and take public transportation. The festival kicks off on Saturday, June 24, 2017 with the Pride Celebration featuring sets by popular artists and DJs, food, and booths by community supporters. On Sunday, June 25, 2017, it&rsquo;s the iconic SF Pride Parade, with over 30 floats, 30,000 participants, and the most vibrant costumes you&rsquo;ll see anywhere. </p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img id=\"1492791923949\" class=\" \" src=\"https://cdn.traveltripper.io/site-assets/192_617_2164/media/2017-04-21-121208/san-francisco-festivals-outside-lands.jpg\" /></p>\n<h4 style=\"text-align: center;\">Outside Lands</h4>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong><em>August 11-13, 2017</em></strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">A local favorite of the summer festival circuit, <a href=\"https://www.sfoutsidelands.com/\">Outside Lands</a> always brings the big names acts everyone wants to see. Held at the beautiful Golden Gate Park, this year&rsquo;s lineup is up to par. Headlining are Metallica, The Who, Gorillaz, Lorde, A Tribe Called Quest. However, there are also some popular indie acts taking the stage this year at the festival. Think Future Islands, Foxygen, and Hamilton Leithauser (previously of The Walkmen). That said, if you&rsquo;re thinking about attending, check out our <a href=\"https://www.stanfordcourt.com/special/#outside-lands\">Outside Lands special</a>, for 20% off your room at Stanford Court Hotel. </p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img id=\"1492791940325\" class=\" \" src=\"https://cdn.traveltripper.io/site-assets/192_617_2164/media/2017-04-21-121207/san-francisco-festivals-hardly-strictly-bluegrass.jpg\" /></p>\n<h4 style=\"text-align: center;\">Hardly Strictly Bluegrass</h4>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><strong>October 6-8, 2017</strong></em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Started by the beloved San Francisco philanthropist Warren Hellman [RIP], <a href=\"http://www.hardlystrictlybluegrass.com/\">Hardly Strictly Bluegrass</a>, or HSB for short is three days of folk, Americana, and bluegrass in Golden Gate Park. Here you&rsquo;ll find legends like Emmylou Harris and Robert Earl Keen, as well as more commercial artists like Jim James and Conor Oberst. Even if you&rsquo;re not keen on bluegrass, the lineup is solid, and always one to get you moving -whether it&rsquo;s tapping your feet or clapping your hands, or straight up dancing. Also, did we mention that it&rsquo;s free, open to the public, and without any commercialization? Because it is, thanks to Hellman. Through HSB his legacy lives on. <br />#LocalTip: Don&rsquo;t drive. Uber or Lyft it, or use public transportation. After all you&rsquo;re in an ideal spot @ SCH. </p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">--</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">BTW - it&rsquo;s the 50th Anniversary of the Summer of Love, and we&rsquo;re running some <a href=\"https://www.stanfordcourt.com/special/#summer-of-love\">great specials</a> at Stanford Court Hotel, from April 8 - August 20.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>"
